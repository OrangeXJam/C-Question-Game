# C-Question-Game

You were a knowledgeable scholar; you had answers for questions that no one even thought of. But as your knowledge circle widened, so did your enemies' numbers. One of them being The Obsidian Raven! He hunts in the shadows, so when you were expanding your knowledge late at night in the library while everyone was sleeping, he took the chance and struck you. With his powerful curse, he was able to steal all your knowledge. The knowledge he could not steal was who you were. Now, the only way to get your knowledge back is to earn it from him again by answering all of his questions, which he will ask using all of the knowledge he stole. Good luck, traveler :)
